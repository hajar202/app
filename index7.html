        The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom actually has a 6x optical zoom camera, but gets its name from the fact that it can achieve a "hybrid" digital-optical zoom of 10x. The only other phone with such a capability right now is the much more expensive Huawei P30 Pro. The Reno 10x Zoom also has a unique "shark fin" pop-up module for its front camera. These factors should be enough to tempt the kind of buyer who always wants the latest and greatest features to show off. 
        
        Under the hood, the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom has the flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and delivers excellent performance across the board, including in today's heaviest mobile games. There's a 4,065mAh battery and a huge 6.6-inch full-HD screen. You can choose between 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage.
        
        The Reno 10x Zoom is a bulky phone and can be awkward to carry around. The glass rear is a little slippery too, but this looks and feels like a very high-end phone. Sadly there's no wireless charging or IP rating.
        
        The cameras are very flexible and the 6x and 10x zoom capabilities are impressive. Photo quality was good in all kinds of situations, though we would have liked better low-light performance. Overall, this is a great phone with features that no other company currently matches at its price level.
